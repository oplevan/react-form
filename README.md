What we would like to see from you is how you would build an application using React, since we cant ask you to build the whole application we would like to ask that you build a form. The form should meet the following requirements

Form fields:

Name
Password
Password confirm
Date of birth
Age
Accept terms

Actions:

Can only submit if all fields are valid
The result of the form to be logged in the console
A message to confirm the form has been successfully submitted

Notes:

We would like to see your UI skills so please do not use any framework or libraries like Bootstrap and Material design
We will be looking at how you execute this and not judging you on design.
We understand this is an open ended test, so please spend as much time you feel is needed to show us your UI developer skills.
We will have an interview to discuss the test, so you will have an opportunity to talk us through your approach
